ok i dont actually know how to use this to make new things.
for right now, just use group and option to make new systems. ill
make something simple to test it out.
annoying thing number one is that you have to make the options local in order to directly edit their 
text values in editor. or else it only changes on load.
its not really that huge of a deal unless you need to change the option class, but keep it in mind.
